                            jQuery.exdent

A small jQuery plugin to enable hanging punctuation[1], an advanced
typographic feature. Elements are only exdented, if they are at the
beginning of a line.

As default,  only <q> elements are exdented,  but you can customize
this to your needs:

    $('body').exdent({
      selector: 'blockquote, q',
      width: '-.5em'
    });

This exdents both blockquotes and <q> by -.5em.

See [2] for a demo and [3] for issues.

Note: Don't confuse this with jQuery.extend. ;-)
