                            jQuery.exdent

A small jQuery plugin to enable hanging punctuation[1], an advanced
typographic feature. Elements are only exdented, if they are at the
beginning of a line. The plugin changes the boring

             "Lorem  ipsum  dolor  sit  amet, consectetuer
             adipiscing elit. Ut a sapien. Aliquam aliquet
             purus  molestie  dolor. Integer  quis eros ut
             erat posuere dictum.

to this:

            "Lorem  ipsum  dolor  sit  amet,  consectetuer
             adipiscing elit. Ut a sapien. Aliquam aliquet
             purus  molestie  dolor. Integer  quis eros ut
             erat posuere dictum.

As default,  only <q> elements are exdented,  but you can customize
this to your needs:

    $('body').exdent({
      selector: 'blockquote, q',
      width: '-.5em'
    });

This exdents both blockquotes and <q> by -.5em.

See [2] for a demo and [3] for issues.

O p t i o n s :

jQuery.exdent understands three option parameters:

- by (String):  the width by which to exdent,  must be negative (as
  long as you don't want to *indent*).
- detect (Boolean or String): whether to autodetect the exdentation
  width (will ignore "width").  If a string is given,  this is used
  for detection, other wise an english opening quote, U+201C.
- selector (String): the elements to exdent, defaults to 'q'.

Note: Don't confuse this with jQuery.extend. ;-)
